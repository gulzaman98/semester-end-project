    <h3>Traditional Paper Box Step-by-Step Instructions</h3>
    <ol class="steps-list">

        <li>Start with a square sheet of paper with the white side facing up. Fold the paper in half horizontally. Crease it well and then unfold it.</li>
        <li>Fold the paper in half vertically. Crease it well and then unfold it.</li>
        <li>Fold the corner of the paper to the center. You’ll do this on each of the 4 corners.</li>
        <li>Fold the next corner to the center of the model.</li>
        <li>Fold the next corner to the center of the model.</li>
        <li>Fold the final corner to the center of the model.</li>
        <li>Rotate the model 45 degrees so it’s square again.</li>
        <li>Fold the top part of the model along the dotted line to the center.</li>
        <li>Fold the bottom part of the model along the dotted line to the center.</li>
        <li>Crease both these folds very well and then unfold them.</li>
        <li>These next 2 steps technically aren’t necessary, but they make 2 later steps slightly easier. Fold the left part of the model along the dotted line to the center.</li>
        <li>Fold the right part of the model along the dotted line to the center.</li>
        <li>Crease both these folds very well and then unfold them.</li>
        <li>Unfold the top and bottom triangles of the paper.</li>
        <li>Fold the right side of the model to the center along the dotted line. Part of this crease is already here, which will make it a bit easier.</li>
        <li>Fold the left side of the model to the center along the dotted line.</li>
        <li>Slowly pull the model open at the top, following the dotted lines. The creases here are already made.</li>
        <li>When you pull the model open, it should take a shape that looks like this. The creases are all already made, so everything should fall into place.</li>
        <li>Fold the flap of paper down along the dotted line that intersects the two triangles. This will form the edge of the box. Fold the top triangle of paper up a little bit to fit into place at the bottom of the box.</li>
        <li>Fold the other side of the box now along the existing creases as you did in steps 17 and 18. The paper should fall into place and give you a shape, just like in step 18.

        Fold the top flap of paper down along the dotted line to form the edge of the box. Fold the top triangle of paper up a little bit to also fit into the bottom of the box, just like in step 19.</li>
