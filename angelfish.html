        <li>Place the square base with the open end facing downward.</li>

        <li>Fold the right and left edges of the top layer toward the center line to form a kite shape.</li>

        <li>Fold the top triangular flap downward and crease sharply.</li>

        <li>Unfold the last three folds to prepare for a petal fold.</li>

        <li>Lift the bottom point upward while opening the sides and flatten carefully to form a long diamond shape.

        <li>Fold one narrow flap upward to begin shaping the fish’s upper fin.</li>

        <li>Fold the opposite narrow flap slightly downward to create the lower fin.</li>
