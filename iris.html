    <h2>How to Fold a Traditional Origami Iris</h2>
    <p>
        Iris is a graceful and artistic origami flower inspired by the elegant shape and flowing petals of real
        iris blossoms. This refined design features smooth, precise folds that create beautifully layered petals,
        forming a delicate and visually striking flower shape. Iris origami is perfect for decoration, handmade
        gifts, craft projects, and creative displays. It also helps improve focus, patience, creativity, and fine
        motor skills, offering a calm, relaxing, and satisfying paper-folding experience.

    <h3>Traditional Paper Iris Step-by-Step Instructions</h3>
    <ol class="steps-list">
        <li>Start with the colored side of the paper facing up. Place the paper flat on the table.</li>

        <li>Fold the paper in half diagonally to form a triangle, then unfold.</li>

        <li>Fold diagonally in the opposite direction and unfold to make clear creases.</li>

        <li>Turn the paper over and fold it in half horizontally. Unfold.</li>

        <li>Fold it in half vertically and unfold to create a grid of creases.</li>

        <li>Using the creases, collapse the paper into a square base.</li>

        <li>Position the square so the open end faces downward.</li>

        <li>Fold the right and left corners toward the center line to form a narrow kite shape.</li>

        <li>Turn the model over and repeat the same folds on the other side.</li>

        <li>Fold the top point downward to begin shaping the iris bud.</li>

        <li>Unfold the last fold and gently open the top layer.</li>

        <li>Flatten the sides inward to form long, elegant petal layers.</li>

        <li>Rotate the model 90 degrees clockwise.</li>

        <li>Fold the outer corners outward slightly to shape the flowing iris petals.</li>

        <li>Turn the model over and repeat the same folds.</li>

        <li>Carefully open the layered folds to create a natural flower form.</li>

        <li>Curve the edges gently to give the petals a soft, flowing look.</li>

        <li>Adjust the folds to create a balanced and elegant shape.</li>

        <li>Refine the petal layers for a clean and graceful finish.</li>

        <li>Smooth out all creases carefully.</li>

        <li>Make small adjustments to improve symmetry.</li>

        <li>Shape the petals gently using your fingers.</li>
