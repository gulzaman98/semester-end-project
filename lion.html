    <h2>How to Fold a Traditional Origami Lion</h2>
    <p>
        The traditional paper origami lion is a bold and powerful animal design that represents courage,
        strength, and leadership. Inspired by the majestic stance and commanding presence of a real lion, this
        model features strong, well-defined folds and a structured form that highlights its distinctive mane
        and proud posture. Origami lions are commonly used for decoration, educational projects, and creative
        displays, helping to enhance focus, hand-eye coordination, and attention to detail while providing a
        fun, engaging, and rewarding paper-folding experience.

    <h3>Traditional Paper Lion Step-by-Step Instructions</h3>
    <ol class="steps-list">
        <li>Start with the colored side of the paper facing up. Place the paper flat on the table.</li>

        <li>Fold the paper in half diagonally to form a triangle, then unfold.</li>

        <li>Fold diagonally in the opposite direction and unfold again. Crease well.</li>

        <li>Turn the paper over and fold it in half horizontally. Unfold.</li>

        <li>Fold it in half vertically and unfold to create clear creases.</li>

        <li>Collapse the paper into a square base using the existing creases.</li>

        <li>Position the square so the open end faces downward.</li>

        <li>Fold the right flap toward the center crease.</li>

        <li>Fold the left flap toward the center crease.</li>

        <li>Turn the model over and repeat the same folds on the other side.</li>

        <li>Fold the top triangular flap downward and crease well.</li>

        <li>Unfold the last three folds completely.</li>

        <li>Lift the top layer and open it upward.</li>

        <li>Perform a petal fold by flattening the sides inward.</li>

        <li>Turn the model over and repeat the petal fold on the other side.</li>

        <li>You should now have a tall diamond-shaped base.</li>

        <li>Fold the top edges inward slightly to shape the lion’s head.</li>

        <li>Carefully pull one flap upward to form the mane and face.</li>

        <li>Fold a small portion at the tip to create the lion’s snout.</li>

        <li>Pull two side flaps outward to shape the front and back legs.</li>

        <li>Fold the bottom flap upward to form the tail.</li>

        <li>Gently curve the back section to give the lion a strong posture.</li>

        <li>Adjust the folds to define the body and mane.</li>

        <li>Shape the legs so the lion can stand properly.</li>

        <li>Refine the head, mane, and tail for a neat finish.</li>

        <li>Smooth out all folds carefully.</li>
