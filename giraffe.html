    <h2>How to Fold a Traditional Origami Giraffe</h2>
    <p>
        The traditional paper origami giraffe is a graceful and creative animal design that represents elegance,
        curiosity, and gentle strength. Inspired by the tall posture and unique patterns of a real giraffe, this
        model features smooth, well-balanced folds and a refined structure that highlights its long neck and
        distinctive form. Origami giraffes are commonly used for decoration, educational activities, and
        creative displays, helping to improve concentration, hand-eye coordination, and attention to detail
        while offering a calming and enjoyable paper-folding experience.

    <h3>Traditional Paper Giraffe Step-by-Step Instructions</h3>
    <ol class="steps-list">
        <li>Start with the colored side of the paper facing up. Place the paper flat on the table.</li>

        <li>Fold the paper in half diagonally to form a triangle, then unfold.</li>

        <li>Fold diagonally in the opposite direction and unfold again. Crease well.</li>

        <li>Turn the paper over and fold it in half horizontally. Unfold.</li>

        <li>Fold it in half vertically and unfold to create clear creases.</li>

        <li>Collapse the paper into a square base using the existing creases.</li>

        <li>Position the square so the open end faces downward.</li>

        <li>Fold the right flap toward the center crease.</li>

        <li>Fold the left flap toward the center crease.</li>

        <li>Turn the model over and repeat the same folds on the other side.</li>

        <li>Fold the top triangular flap downward and crease well.</li>

        <li>Unfold the last three folds completely.</li>

        <li>Lift the top layer and open it upward.</li>

        <li>Perform a petal fold by flattening the sides inward.</li>

        <li>Turn the model over and repeat the petal fold on the other side.</li>

        <li>You should now have a tall diamond-shaped base.</li>

        <li>Fold the top edges upward to form the giraffe’s long neck.</li>

        <li>Carefully pull one flap upward and shape it to create the head.</li>

        <li>Fold a small portion at the tip to define the giraffe’s snout.</li>

        <li>Pull two side flaps outward to form the front and back legs.</li>

        <li>Fold the bottom flap slightly upward to create the tail.</li>

        <li>Gently curve the neck to give a natural giraffe posture.</li>

        <li>Adjust the folds to define the body and legs.</li>

        <li>Shape the legs so the giraffe can stand properly.</li>

        <li>Refine the head, neck, and tail for a neat finish.</li>

        <li>Smooth out all folds carefully.</li>

        <li>Make final adjustments to improve balance and posture.</li>
