    <h2>How to Fold a Traditional Origami Crane</h2>
    <p>
        The traditional paper origami penguin is a fun and popular origami model, especially loved by kids.
        It is inspired by the cute penguin bird found in cold regions.
        This easy origami design helps children learn basic folding skills while improving focus and creativity.
        The origami penguin is a great way to enjoy paper art and develop patience through simple step-by-step folds.

    <h3>Traditional Paper Penguin Step-by-Step Instructions</h3>
    <ol class="steps-list">
        <li>Start with the colored side facing up, with the paper in a diamond position (so a corner points up).

            Fold and unfold the paper in half diagonally (top corner to bottom corner). Then, turn the paper over.</li>
        <li>Fold the top edges inward, but don’t fold all the way to the centerline. Leave a gap between the edges (see
            the next diagram for reference).</li>
        <li>
            Turn the paper over.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fold the side corners inward along the dotted lines.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fold the bottom corner up, using the bottom corners of the flaps from Step 4 as a guide.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fold the paper in half vertically, using the crease you made back in Step 1.
        </li>
        <li>
            Make an outside reverse fold at the top corner to form the penguin’s head.<br>

            🐧 Folding tip: Make this step easier by pre-creasing the head using a valley fold and a mountain fold at
            the same level on both sides as shown in the text.
        </li>
        <li>
            Great work! Your paper penguin is complete, standing proudly with its sleek shape and charming character.
        </li>
