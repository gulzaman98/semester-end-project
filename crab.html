        <li>Start with a square sheet of paper placed flat on the table, colored side facing down.</li>

        <li>Fold the paper diagonally in half to form a triangle and crease firmly.</li>

        <li>Unfold the paper back into a square.</li>

        <li>Fold diagonally in the opposite direction and crease well.</li>

        <li>Unfold again to return to the square shape.</li>

        <li>Fold the paper in half horizontally and crease.</li>

        <li>Unfold, then fold it vertically in half, crease firmly, and unfold.</li>

        <li>Using the existing creases, collapse the paper into a square base (preliminary base).</li>

        <li>Place the square base with the open end facing downward.</li>

        <li>Fold the right and left edges of the top layer toward the center line to form a kite shape.</li>

        <li>Turn the model over and repeat the same folds on the other side.</li>

        <li>Fold the top triangular flap downward and crease sharply.</li>

        <li>Unfold the last three folds to prepare for shaping the body.</li>

        <li>Lift the bottom point upward while opening the sides and flatten carefully to form a wider diamond shape.
        </li>

        <li>Turn the model over and repeat the same fold on the other side.</li>

        <li>Fold the upper side flaps outward to begin forming the crab’s claws.</li>

        <li>Shape the tips of the claws by making small diagonal folds.</li>

        <li>Fold the lower side flaps outward to create the crab’s legs.</li>

        <li>Repeat on the opposite side to maintain symmetry.</li>

        <li>Gently squash fold the side layers to widen the body.</li>

        <li>Fold the top point slightly backward to round the crab’s head.</li>

        <li>Create small inside reverse folds to refine the claw shapes.</li>

        <li>Adjust the leg folds by angling them slightly outward.</li>

        <li>Flatten the center body area to give the crab a solid base.</li>

        <li>Curve the claws gently using your fingers for a natural look.</li>
