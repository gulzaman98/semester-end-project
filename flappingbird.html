    <h2>How to Fold a Traditional Origami Flapping Bird</h2>
    <p> Flapping Bird is a classic and interactive origami model that beautifully captures the motion of a bird in
        flight. Crafted with precise folds and well-balanced wings, this design creates a realistic flapping movement
        when the tail is gently pulled. Inspired by the elegance and freedom of flying birds, the model features clean
        lines and symmetrical structure, forming a graceful and lively paper creation. Flapping Bird origami is ideal
        for craft activities, school projects, and decorative displays, while also enhancing focus, creativity, and fine
        motor skills. It provides a fun, hands-on paper-folding experience that combines movement, imagination, and
        artistic expression. </p>


    <h3>Traditional Paper Flapping Bird Step-by-Step Instructions</h3>
    <ol class="steps-list">
        <li>Start with a square sheet of paper placed flat on the table with the colored side facing down.</li>

        <li>Fold the paper diagonally in half to form a triangle, then crease firmly.</li>

        <li>Fold the triangle in half again to make a smaller triangle.</li>

        <li>Unfold the last fold to return to the larger triangle shape.</li>

        <li>Lift the top layer from the bottom corner and squash fold it to form a square shape.</li>

        <li>Turn the model over and repeat the squash fold on the other side to create a square base.</li>

        <li>Position the square so the open end is facing downward.</li>

        <li>Fold the right and left edges toward the center line to form a kite shape.</li>

        <li>Turn the model over and repeat the same folds on the other side.</li>

        <li>Fold the top triangular flap downward and crease well.</li>

        <li>Unfold the last three folds to prepare for the next step.</li>

        <li>Lift the bottom point upward, opening the sides, and squash fold it along the existing creases to form a
            long diamond shape (bird base).</li>

        <li>Turn the model over and repeat the same fold on the other side.</li>

        <li>Fold one narrow flap upward to form the bird’s neck.</li>

        <li>Fold the other narrow flap upward to create the tail.</li>

        <li>Create the head by making a small inside reverse fold at the tip of the neck.</li>

        <li>Fold the wings downward on both sides to shape the bird.</li>

        <li>Adjust the wings so they are even and symmetrical.</li>

        <li>Gently hold the bird by the body and pull the tail outward to test the flapping movement.</li>

        <li>Make small adjustments to improve balance and smoothness.</li>

        <li>Your Flapping Bird origami is now complete.</li>
