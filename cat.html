    <h2>How to Fold a Traditional Origami Cat</h2>
    <p>
        The traditional paper origami cat is a charming and playful animal design that represents curiosity,
        agility, and comfort. Inspired by the graceful movements and gentle posture of a real cat, this model
        features smooth folds and a simple yet expressive structure that captures its cute and lively form.
        Origami cats are commonly used for decoration, gifts, and creative crafts, helping to improve focus,
        fine motor skills, and attention to detail while offering a fun, calming, and rewarding paper-folding
        experience.

    <h3>Traditional Paper Cat Step-by-Step Instructions</h3>
    <ol class="steps-list">
        <li>Start with the colored side of the paper facing up. Place the paper flat on the table.</li>

        <li>Fold the paper in half diagonally to form a triangle, then unfold.</li>

        <li>Fold diagonally in the opposite direction and unfold again. Crease well.</li>

        <li>Turn the paper over and fold it in half horizontally. Unfold.</li>

        <li>Fold it in half vertically and unfold to create clear creases.</li>

        <li>Collapse the paper into a square base using the existing creases.</li>

        <li>Position the square so the open end faces downward.</li>

        <li>Fold the right flap toward the center crease.</li>

        <li>Fold the left flap toward the center crease.</li>

        <li>Turn the model over and repeat the same folds on the other side.</li>

        <li>Fold the top triangular flap downward and crease well.</li>

        <li>Unfold the last three folds completely.</li>

        <li>Lift the top layer and open it upward.</li>

        <li>Perform a petal fold by flattening the sides inward.</li>

        <li>Turn the model over and repeat the petal fold on the other side.</li>

        <li>You should now have a tall diamond-shaped base.</li>

        <li>Fold the top edges slightly inward to shape the cat’s head.</li>

        <li>Carefully pull one flap upward to form the ears.</li>

        <li>Fold the tip downward slightly to define the face.</li>

        <li>Pull two side flaps outward to shape the front and back legs.</li>

        <li>Fold the bottom flap upward to form the tail.</li>

        <li>Gently curve the tail for a natural look.</li>

        <li>Adjust the folds to define the body shape.</li>

        <li>Shape the legs so the cat can stand properly.</li>

        <li>Refine the ears and face for a neat finish.</li>
