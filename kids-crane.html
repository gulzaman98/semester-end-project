    <h2>How to Fold a Traditional Origami Crane</h2>
    <p>The traditional paper origami crane is probably the most famous of all origami It’s designed after <br> the
        Japanese red-crowned crane. In Japanese mythology, this crane is known as the “Honourable Lord Crane,” and its
        wings carry souls up to heaven.</p>
    <h3>Traditional Paper Crane Step-by-Step Instructions</h3>
    <ol class="steps-list">

        <li>Start with the white side of the paper facing up and fold in half diagonally.</li>

        <li>Fold in half again along the dotted line.</li>

        <li>Fold that flap back and squash fold this flap down.</li>

        <li>Turn the model over. We’re going to repeat the last few steps on the other side.</li>

        <li>Fold the flap over to the left along the dotted line and squash fold this flap down.</li>

        <li>You now have a completed square or preliminary base. With a few more folds, we’ll turn it into a bird base.

            Fold the side flap to the center along the dotted line.

            Crease this fold well and then unfold it.</li>

        <li>Fold the flap on the other side to the center along the dotted line.

            Crease this well and unfold.</li>

        <li>Fold the top down along the dotted line.

            Crease this well and unfold.</li>

        <li>Lift the top flap of paper up along the crease you just made. We’re going to make a petal fold.

            Continue lifting up and push in the sides along the creases you made in the previous couple of steps.

            Flatten everything along the creases you already made.</li>

        <li>The completed petal fold.

            Turn the model over. We’re going to make a petal fold on the other side, too.</li>

        <li>Fold the side to the center along the dotted line.

            Crease this well and then unfold.</li>

        <li>Fold the other side to the center along the dotted line.

            Crease this well and unfold.</li>

        <li>Fold the top down along the dotted line.

            Crease this well and unfold.</li>

        <li>Lift the top flap of paper up along the crease you just made. We’re going to make another petal fold.

            Continue lifting up and push in the sides along the creases you made in the previous couple of steps.

            Flatten everything along the creases you already made.</li>

        <li>The completed petal fold. At this point, you also have a completed a bird base.

            Next, we’re going to fold the neck and the tail. Fold the top flap on the right to the center along the
            dotted line.</li>

        <li>Fold the top flap on the left to the center along the dotted line as well.</li>

        <li>Turn the model over. We’re going to repeat the last two steps on the other side.</li>

        <li>Fold the top flap on the left to the center along the dotted line.</li>

        <li>Fold the top flap on the right to the center along the dotted line as well.</li>

        <li>Fold the long, thin section of paper on the right up along the dotted line.

            Crease this well and unfold.</li>

        <li>Fold the long, thin section of paper on the left up just like you did on the other side.

            Crease this well and unfold.</li>

        <li>Turn the model over. We’re going to repeat the last couple of steps on the other side.</li>

        <li>Fold the long, thin section of paper on the right up along the dotted line. There’s already a crease here,
            but now you’re going to fold it the other way.

            Crease this well and unfold.</li>

        <li>Fold the long, thin section of paper on the left up just like you did on the other side. There’s also a
            crease here already, and you’re also going to fold it the other way.

            Crease this well and unfold.</li>

        <li>Now, we’re going to make an inside reverse fold along the creases you just made on the right side of the
            model.

            Lift the paper up inside the model along the creases you already made and flatten everything.<br>

            👉 Folding tip: With some practice, you can skip steps 20 to 24 and directly make the inside reverse fold.
        </li>

        <li>Make another inside reverse fold along the creases you already made along the left side of the model.

            Lift the paper up inside the model along the creases you already made and flatten everything.</li>

        <li>Now, we’re going to fold the head. Fold the long, thin section of paper on the right down along the dotted
            line.

            Crease this well and unfold.</li>

        <li>Turn the model over so we can repeat this on the other side.</li>

        <li>Fold the long, thin section of paper on the left side now down along the dotted line. This is folded the
            opposite way along the crease you already folded on the other side.

            Crease this well and unfold.</li>

        <li>Turn the model over again so it’s facing the way it was before.</li>

        <li>Fold the head by making an inside reverse fold along the creases you made in the previous couple of steps.
            The head is then folded inside the neck.<br>

            👉 Folding tip: With some practice, you can skip steps 27 to 30 and directly make the inside reverse fold.
        </li>

        <li>Fold down the wings on both sides along the dotted line.<br>

            👉 Shaping tip: You can make the back of the crane flatter by pulling on the wings and adjust it to your
            taste.</li>
