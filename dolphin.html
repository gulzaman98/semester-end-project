    <h2>How to Fold a Traditional Origami Dolphin Fish</h2>
    <p>
        Dolphin origami is an elegant and expressive paper model inspired by the smooth movement and intelligent nature
        of
        dolphins found in oceans and seas. With its streamlined body, curved dorsal fin, and pointed snout, this design
        captures the graceful appearance of a dolphin using clean and well-defined paper folds. The model features
        smooth
        lines and balanced proportions that give it a realistic and visually appealing look. Dolphin origami is suitable
        for beginners as well as intermediate folders who enjoy marine and animal-themed creations. It is ideal for
        craft
        projects, classroom activities, and decorative displays. Folding this model helps improve concentration,
        patience,
        and fine motor skills. The symmetrical structure enhances accuracy and attention to detail. Its dynamic shape
        adds a
        sense of motion and elegance to the final model. Dolphin origami offers a calm and enjoyable paper-folding
        experience that encourages creativity and artistic expression.

    <h3>Traditional Paper Dolphin Fish Step-by-Step Instructions</h3>
    <ol class="steps-list">
        <li>Start with a square sheet of paper placed flat on the table, colored side facing down.</li>

        <li>Fold the paper diagonally in half to form a triangle and crease firmly.</li>

        <li>Unfold the paper back into a square.</li>

        <li>Fold diagonally in the opposite direction and crease well.</li>

        <li>Unfold again to return to the square shape.</li>

        <li>Fold the paper in half horizontally and crease.</li>

        <li>Unfold, then fold it vertically in half, crease firmly, and unfold.</li>

        <li>Using the existing creases, collapse the paper into a square base (preliminary base).</li>

        <li>Place the square base with the open end facing downward.</li>

        <li>Fold the right and left edges of the top layer toward the center line to form a kite shape.</li>

        <li>Turn the model over and repeat the same folds on the other side.</li>

        <li>Fold the top triangular flap downward and crease sharply.</li>

        <li>Unfold the last three folds to prepare for shaping the body.</li>

        <li>Lift the bottom point upward while opening the sides and flatten carefully to form a long diamond shape.
        </li>

        <li>Turn the model over and repeat the same fold on the other side.</li>

        <li>Fold one narrow flap upward to begin forming the dolphin’s dorsal fin.</li>

        <li>Fold the opposite narrow flap slightly downward to shape the lower body.</li>

        <li>Fold the top point forward to create the dolphin’s head and snout.</li>

        <li>Make a small inside reverse fold at the tip to define the mouth.</li>

        <li>Fold the back section outward to begin shaping the tail.</li>

        <li>Split the tail into two sections using a small inside reverse fold.</li>

        <li>Flatten and spread the tail to create a fluke shape.</li>

        <li>Curve the body gently by pressing along the center crease.</li>

        <li>Adjust the dorsal fin to stand upright.</li>

        <li>Refine the head shape by soft folding around the snout.</li>

        <li>Ensure both sides of the body are symmetrical.</li>

        <li>Smooth out all creases for a clean finish.</li>

        <li>Make small adjustments to improve the dolphin’s flow and balance.</li>

        <li>Shape the body slightly upward to give a swimming motion.</li>

        <li>Check overall alignment and refine any uneven folds.</li>

        <li>Your Dolphin origami is now complete and ready for display.</li>
